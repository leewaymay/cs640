Assumptions:
1. For receiver side, the time out is initially set to 5 seconds. The first packet is treated as seq_num = o according to the time out update equations.

2. Amonut of Data transfered/received doesn't count duplicate data packets.

3. fast re-transmission is only invoked once, i.e. when the duplicate ack is 4. If more duplicate ack keeps arriving, no more fast re-transmission.

4. The output time is in unit of seconds. Data is in unit of bytes.
